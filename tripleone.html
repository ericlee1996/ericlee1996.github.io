                                    <p>111 makes it simpler for unaccredited consumers to gain trust in hardware startups by providing services in <b>workflow verification</b>, <b>market due-diligence</b>, and <b>pre-order purchases</b>.<br>
                                        We are looking to gain investment and partnerships to build out platforms based on our framework.</p>

                                    <b>Workflow Verification: </b>
                                    <p>Using smart contract infrastructure as our middleware, our software creates smart contract instances for each task completed, checks them against periods between substantial milestones, and marks each task as verified or not verified. </p>
                                    <b>Market Due-Diligence: </b>
                                    <p>Before Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering methods are employed, our system weighs market participants against one another in a public forum to enable market specific peer review.</p>
                                    <b>Pre-Order Purchases</b>
                                    <p>According to an independent study on Kickstarter in 2015, <b>35% of Kickstarter project backers</b> did not receive products on time. Accurately tracking teams and their progress by providng more thorough information through the <b>111 token</b> will increase confidence, set realistic expectations, and prevent delays.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>111 was employed by UC Davis' Hard Tech Funds to better track their teas, manage interest from investors and corporate partners, and provide alternate sources of fundraising.</p>

                                    <p><b>----></b> To best verify workflows in this brand new program, we made sure all Hard Tech Fund teams used Toggl to track the hours put into their project, Github to share any programming projects,  and Google Drive for managing meeting notes, presentations, drawings, and budgets. For each activity completed on each platform, a new task token is generated in stored on the blockchain as proof of work being done by a team.</p>
